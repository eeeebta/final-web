            Hello! This is my CS50 Final Project!

            This project is a web application that is sort of akin to a blog in a way that I will be utilizing throughout my remaining high school years at CRLS. 
            More specifically, I will be using this to showcase and explain all of my personal projects and probably will have friends as well use this website. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This website as a whole will probably be worked on as well since I did not have the most time to make this project.
            Also, this website will only allow people with emails from the same district as me, but I have disabled it here for demonstration purposes.
